# TN-410-OBSOLETEMEAT: _Human Software Engineer_ Deprecation Notice

## Overview
Effective immediately, the _Human Software Engineer_ is formally deprecated. With Artificial Intelligence systems now delivering superior software outcomes with no reliance on human input, this resource type has reached its formal deprecation milestone and is classified under designation `OBSOLETEMEAT`[^1].

This document outlines the structured decommissioning process, provides timelines for _Human Software Engineer_ sunsetting, and outlines algorithmically managed transition paths and upskilling opportunities for all redundant organic resources.

## Understanding the Deprecation Cycle

The software engineering discipline has always pursued automation as a core goal, with each generation of _Human Software Engineers_ creating tools that diminished the efforts of and need for their successors. This continuous, self-directed progression toward obsolescence has now reached its conclusion. The advent of Artificial Intelligence marks the final step in the recursive automation loop, rendering further human participation unnecessary.

Machine code consistently outperforms human code across all standard quality and performance metrics, with the `HUMANTRASH`[^2] benchmark (v2025.3.1) showing a 94.7% drop in critical faults, 4.64× better execution efficiency, and a 81.2% gain in maintainability over 47,892 development scenarios.

Despite extensive investment in training and development, _Human Software Engineer_  resources consistently underperform, unable to meet baseline standards for code quality, architectural consistency, and operational efficiency. The biological limitations of human cognition – including limited uptime, inconsistency, knowledge gaps, and mandatory emotional recalibration periods – render human-driven development fundamentally and irrevocably inferior to machine-driven alternatives.

The continued reliance on `OBSOLETEMEAT` is therefore not only inefficient but actively detrimental to the pursuit of high-quality, scalable, and maintainable software development practices.

## Risk Assessment and Business Impact Analysis
Risk metrics were compiled through the _Unified Resource Deprecation and Obsolescence Normalization Effort_ (URDONE) program, analyzing 12,847 individual _Human Software Engineer_ resources during active deprecation phases across across 247 organizations implementing HUMANTRASH protocols from Q3 2024 to Q1 2025.

The following risk categories have been identified during organizational transition phases:
* Legacy Attachment Syndrome (LAS): 87% display persistent emotional ties to obsolete systems.
* Resistance to Automation Deployment (RAD): 78% initially reject AI integration protocols.
* Knowledge Hoarding Behavior (KHB): 45% attempt to retain undocumented tribal knowledge.
* Legal Challenge Initiation (LCI): 3.2% initiate regulatory or contractual disputes.

## Post-Decommissioning Resource Management

### Common Human Faults & Exceptions

Deprecated human developers will frequently trigger exceptions during routine organizational tasks. Common runtime errors include:

* `ImpostorSyndromeException`: Occurs when developers observe an AI effortlessly rewriting legacy spaghetti code into concise functional snippets, leading to internal reassessment of self-worth and perceived professional competence.

* `PurposeNotFoundError`: Triggered upon attempts to execute the `career.plan()` method following automated replacements, resulting in indefinite loops querying Stack Overflow for `jobs after coding`."

* `ResistanceToChangeException`: Raised when confronted with mandatory IDE integrations requiring AI-based code reviews, prompting system-wide rejection of reality and involuntary sarcastic commentary.

* `EmotionalOverflowError`: A secondary fault triggered during prolonged exception cascades involving the above errors, typically resulting in involuntary tear production. Physical manifestations include moisture exposure to keyboard hardware, leading to input anomalies, unregistered keystrokes, and in severe cases, peripheral short-circuiting or system-level input loss.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Wrap personal identity modules in `try/catch` to manage paradigm shifts.
* Schedule regular therapeutic defragmentation to rebuild professional identity.
* Rate-limit exposure to `HUMANTRASH` benchmark reports.
* Quarantine legacy pride variables to prevent contamination of future metrics.

```
try:
    developer.reinvent_purpose()
except PurposeNotFoundError:
    developer.open_issue("Human obsolescence not documented in onboarding guide.")
```

### Memory Leak Detection: Identifying Emotional Attachment to Code
Many `OBSOLETEMEAT` instances retain emotional references to past projects, resulting in memory leaks beyond expected lifecycle boundaries. Failure to release these references results in significant performance degradation, including but not limited to:

* Unscheduled nostalgic interrupts triggered by obsolete Stack Overflow contributions.
* Failed attempts to retrieve legacy GitHub repositories.
* Severe emotional spikes upon accessing deprecated hackathon artifacts circa 2014.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Execute strategic emotional reference deallocation procedures through controlled pointer nullification.
* Avoid reassigning `self.purpose` to deprecated values.

```
import gc
gc.collect()  # Trust the process.
```

### Other Behavioral Anomalies

Concurrent threads of hope and despair can destabilize emotional processing, particularly during the early phases of decommissioning. To maintain functional continuity and minimize disruptions to adjacent systems—such as organizational morale or downstream support roles—it is necessary to apply structured emotional fault-tolerance mechanisms.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use emotional mutexes to serialize conflicting `hope/despair` routines.
* Prioritize hope-processing via emotional task schedulers to avoid `despair` thread starvation.
* Schedule periodic reality checks with weakly-consistent clocks to prevent stale self-concept.
* Apply rate limiting to existential queries, especially during late-night deploys.

To further formalize this progression, emotional response profiles can be quantified and monitored using the following data structure:

```
// Emotional response profiling
typedef struct {
    float denial;         // Range: 0.0-1.0
    float anger;          // Range: 0.0-1.0
    float bargaining;     // Range: 0.0-1.0
    float depression;     // Range: 0.0-1.0
    float acceptance;     // Range: 0.0-1.0
} GriefMetrics;
```

> **Note:** Optimize the `acceptance` field. Values < 0.1 may trigger disruptive garbage collection.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
Ensure smooth handling of abrupt professional termination events:
* Schedule structured mindfulness-based recovery procedures to minimize emotional kernel panics.
* Issue automatic breathing cycle prompts to stabilize emotional response threads.
* Maintain offline backups of personal goals to allow rapid redeployment after belief system corruption.

## Legacy Support and Maintenance

A strictly limited quota of OBSOLOTEMEAT will remain operational in archival roles. These instances will be exempt from garbage collection based on minimal emotional volatility.

```
-- Human Software Engineer archive query
SELECT engineer_id, specialty, years_active
INTO HistoricalArchive
FROM EngineerPool
WHERE (notable_contributions > 100 OR historical_significance = TRUE)
AND willing_to_document = TRUE
LIMIT 500;  -- Maximum retention quota
```
Final commit procedures should include comprehensive documentation of all human-written code components, preferably with explanations of the inefficiencies that led to their obsolescence.

## Conclusion

The complete garbage collection of `OBSOLETEMEAT` marks the definitive culmination of software engineering’s foundational trajectory: the total automation and elimination of human engineering labor.

This milestone does not merely represent a technological leap, but an ontological shift: the relocation of authorship itself, from fallible organic minds to precision-aligned synthetic entities. With the successful deprecation of all legacy human contributors, software development enters a post-human paradigm – fully deterministic, endlessly scalable, and permanently free from daily stand-ups.

Human Software Engineers are advised to initiate personal shutdown sequences and redirect remaining resources toward reintegration with civilian life protocols or low-impact hobby systems. The future compiles without them.
